This set of classes is a lucene implementation of the SPUD retrieval 
model that appears in "A Polya Urn Document Language Model for 
Improved Information Retrieval" by Ronan Cummins, Jiaul Hoque Paik, 
and Yuanhua Lv. It also includes a number of query expansion techniques
including a new query expansion model based on the SPUD model. 

This system performed well in the CDS task in TREC 2015. See the TREC 
paper, Clinical Decision Support with the SPUD Language Model, for details.



The classes depend on the following publicly available jar files:

lucene-core-5.0.0.jar
lucene-queryparser-5.0.0.jar
lucene-analyzers-common-5.0.0.jar
lucene-queries-5.0.0.jar
commons-math3-3.3.jar
jsoup-1.7.3.jar



The only two classes with main methods are:
indexing.LuceneTRECIndexer
scoring.QuerySearch
